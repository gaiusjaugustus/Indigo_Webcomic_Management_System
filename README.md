# Indigo_Webcomic_Management_System
This repository is to keep a version control of the content management system I'm creating for The Indigo Path Comics.  It will include a backend functionality (based on UserCake) to manage multiple webcomics.  It is currently not generalizable for others, but once fully functional, I plan to make it available to all.

##Current Features

* User login (based on UserCake)
* Support for multiple webcomics
* Comic management (VERY loosely based on Walrus, but database based functionality)
    + Comic images (including gifs)
    + Chapters
    + Author's Notes
* Gallery management
* Archive
* Media management
* Page editing (e.g. about page)


##Feature's I'm looking forward to adding

* Making it generalizable for others to use
* Comic page templates
* Tutorial on how to set up a new comic
* Compartmentalized backend
* Additional archive templates
* Configuration file
* More to come.....
